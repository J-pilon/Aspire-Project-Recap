## Lead Engineer â€“ Aspire Application

As the lead engineer on the Aspire project, a Rails-based platform developed for a U.S. insurance company, I spearheaded the automation of agent registration processes with carriers. This initiative eliminated approximately 90% of repetitive administrative tasks, enabling staff to concentrate on higher-value activities.

### Industry Immersion and User-Centric Design

From the project's inception, I prioritized a deep understanding of the client's industry, daily workflows, and specific terminology. This comprehensive insight informed close collaboration with designers to refine the UI/UX, ensuring the application was intuitive and aligned seamlessly with real-world tasks.

### Advanced Automation and Technical Challenges

A cornerstone of the application was a suite of bots designed to automate the intricate carrier registration process, allowing agents to commence policy sales without delay. Developing these bots required navigating complex technical challenges, including:

- Gaining in-depth knowledge of Chromiumâ€™s publish/subscribe architecture  
- Addressing DOM traversal and manipulation across deeply nested iFrames  
- Accurately locating and interacting with elements using precise frame context  

### Internal Tooling for Enhanced Development Efficiency

To expedite bot development and increase reliability, I engineered internal tools such as a REPL for interactive testing and generators for scaffolding new bots. These tools significantly reduced build times and enhanced the robustness of the automation suite.

### Outcome and Impact

The culmination of these efforts was a robust, user-friendly application that streamlined agent onboarding and operations. By automating complex workflows and improving usability, the Aspire platform significantly increased operational efficiencyâ€”freeing up internal teams to focus on strategic initiatives instead of administrative overhead.
